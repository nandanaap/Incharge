# Public Assets Folder

Place your images and logo files here:

- IN-Charge-LOGO.png (for header logo)
- hero-image.jpg (for hero section background)
- team-photo.jpg (for about page)
- brand-video-thumbnail.jpg (for video placeholder)
- Any other images needed for the site

Files in this folder are served directly by Vite at the root URL.
Example: public/IN-Charge-LOGO.png becomes /IN-Charge-LOGO.png in your app.
